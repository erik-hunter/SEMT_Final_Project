Changes from proposal to implementation:
1. We initially wanted a user to confirm that they were still alive, before we sent out their posts. For the sake of simplicity, when a user is declared dead, their posts are automatically sent out.
	
Additional features from the proposal:
1. We have a full-fledged user system, with email confirmation of accounts.
2. Posts are delivered via email (action mailer)
3. We also added bootstrap.
